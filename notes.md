## Ideas

### Our ideas
- **text classification:** predict political orientation from users' tweets
- **topic modeling:** identify topics in politicians' tweets to understand which topics are discussed by which parties
- **sentiment analysis:** fine-tune a model on italian tweets (either from italian models or from english models) to perform sentiment analysis and compare it to some baseline (potentially sentita?)
- **final goal:** predict election outcome? (potentially majority vote of predicted class of tweets)

### Chat's ideas (to discuss)
- **stance detection:** instead of performing standard sentiment analysis, determine a user position towards a specific party or policy
- **linguistic style analysis**: investigate linguistic features (other than topics) across political orientations
- **framing analysis:** analyse how different groups frame the same issues
- **temporal shift detection:** track how language and topics evolve before and after events
- **gender-based analysis:** self-explanatory
- **final goal:** map the landscape of political discourse
